	abstract = {This paper provides a comparative study about seasonal influence on editorial decisions for papers submitted to two peer review journals. We distinguish a specialized one, the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society (JSCS) and an interdisciplinary one, Entropy. Dates of electronic submission for about 600 papers to JSCS and 2500 to Entropy have been recorded over 3 recent years. Time series of either accepted or rejected papers are subsequently analyzed. We take either editors or authors view points into account, thereby considering magnitudes and probabilities. In this sample, it is found that there are distinguishable peaks and dips in the time series, demonstrating preferred months for the submission of papers. It is also found that papers are more likely accepted if they are submitted during a few specific months—these depending on the journal. The probability of having a rejected paper also appears to be seasonally biased. In view of clarifying reports with contradictory findings, we discuss previously proposed conjectures for such effects, like holiday effects and the desk rejection by editors. We conclude that, in this sample, the type of journal, specialized or multidisciplinary, seems to be the drastic criterion for distinguishing the outcomes rates.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for ﬁnding features in the analysis of variable distributions stemming from time series. We apply the methodology to the case of submitted and accepted papers in peer-reviewed journals. We provide a comparative study of editorial decisions for papers submitted to two peer-reviewed journals: the Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society (JSCS) and this MDPI Entropy journal. We cover three recent years for which the fate of submitted papers—about 600 papers to JSCS and 2500 to Entropy—is completely determined. Instead of comparing the number distributions of these papers as a function of time with respect to a uniform distribution, we analyze the relevant probabilities, from which we derive the information entropy. It is argued that such probabilities are indeed more relevant for authors than the actual number of submissions. We tie this entropy analysis to the so called diversity of the variable distributions. Furthermore, we emphasize the correspondence between the entropy and the diversity with inequality measures, like the Herﬁndahl-Hirschman index and the Theil index, itself being in the class of entropy measures; the Gini coefﬁcient which also measures the diversity in ranking is calculated for further discussion. In this sample, the seasonal aspects of the peer review process are outlined. It is found that the use of such indices, non linear transformations of the data distributions, allow us to distinguish features and evolutions of the peer review process as a function of time as well as comparing the non-uniformity of distributions. Furthermore, t- and z-statistical tests are applied in order to measure the signiﬁcance (p-level) of the ﬁndings, that is, whether papers are more likely to be accepted if they are submitted during a few speciﬁc months or during a particular “season”; the predictability strength depends on the journal.},

For example, the day of the week when a paper is submitted to a peer reviewed journal correlates with whether that paper is accepted. Using an econometric analysis (a mix of log–log and semi-log based on undated and panel structured data) we ﬁnd that more papers are submitted to certain peer review journals on particular weekdays than others, with fewer papers being submitted on weekends. Seasonal effects, geographical information as well as potential changes over time are examined. This ﬁnding rests on a large (178,000) and reliable sample; the journals polled are broadly recognized (Nature, Cell, PLOS ONE and Physica A). Day of the week effect in the submission of accepted papers should be of interest to many researchers, editors and publishers, and perhaps also to managers and psychologists.},

	abstract = {Intriguing unforced regularities in human behaviors have been reported in varied research domains, including scientometrics. In this study we examine the manuscript submission behavior of researchers, with a focus on its monthly pattern. With a large and reliable dataset which records the submission history of articles published on 10 multidisciplinary journals and 10 management journals over a five-year period (2013–2017), we observe a prominent turn-of-the-month submission effect for accepted papers in management journals but not multidisciplinary journals. This effect gets more pronounced in submissions to top-tier journals and when the first day of a month happens to be a Saturday or Sunday. Sense of ceremony is proposed as a likely explanation of this effect, since the first day of a month is a fundamental temporal landmark which has a ‘fresh start effect’ on researchers. To conclude, an original and interesting day-of-the-month effect in the academia is reported in this study, which calls for more research attention.},

	abstract = {A recent discussion on possible seasonal bias in editorial decisions yielded discrepant results for different journals. All studies agreed that further investigations in different fields are necessary. In this article submission and acceptance data are analyzed using a sample that is much larger than the previously investigated datasets. Specifically all the 15,478 submissions to EPL (formerly Europhysics Letters) submitted within the 12 years from 1999 to 2010 are included. While trends in the yearly number of submitted papers can be seen, these are also reflected in the number of accepted and rejected papers. Monthly fluctuations in the rate of acceptance are strong; averaging over several years smoothes these fluctuations and shows a clear maximum in July. Even more conspicuous fluctuations are found for the acceptance time, i.e. the duration of the reviewing process. Averaging over several years shows that this process is longest for manuscripts submitted in January, May and October.},

	abstract = {At a top psychology journal, Psychological Science (PS), submissions peak during the summer months. We tested whether this seasonal submission bias decreases the likelihood of a paper being accepted in that period. Month of submission data was obtained for all 575 publications in PS for the period 2003–2006. Whereas submissions to PS were higher in the summer, there was no evidence that most accepted publications were originally submitted in the summer. Thus, contributors submit to PS when the likelihood of acceptance is the lowest – creating their own entrance barrier. A similar seasonal pattern was not identified for Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, another top psychology journal. Using the Web of Knowledge database, we further assessed whether overcoming the seasonal entrance barrier influences the number of citations a paper receives in subsequent years. We discuss the possibility that the different rejections policies in the two journals, employing desk rejections or not, may explain this discrepancy, and explore a range of alternative hypotheses.},

For example, Weinberger et al.3 looked at a million abstracts across many scientiﬁc disciplines to look for a correlation between the advice he has oﬀered to students (such as short and simple abstracts are better) to see if objective measures backed this up; in this case, the longer, more redundant abstract had more citations. In contrast, Letchford4 looked at the most cited papers from Web of Science between 1999 and 2008 to assess not only length but also word frequency. In this study, articles with shorter abstracts fared better; he claims that adding a 5letter word decreased the number of citations by 0.02\%.},
